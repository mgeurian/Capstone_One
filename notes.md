1. use js for notes - CANCEL THE NOTES PORTION **ONLY BASIC CRUD**
notes are located in the following files:
forms.py ln19
models.py ln121
removed Note from models import in app.py
removed NotesForm from forms import in app.py

2. don't use js if not absolutely necessary

3. but focus on python for everything else

create a roadmap to completion for this capstone

then create an additional roadmap for later on down the road
